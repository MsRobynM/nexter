# Nexter repository

Based on Udemy Advanced CSS Course by Jonas Schmedtmann

Final prject with emphasis on GRIDs

This will include significant milestones

Prep with: 1) npm install  2) create img folder manually

To initiate automatic SASS compile & watch run: npm start

The UDEMY course is complete as of the commit labeled final. Anything further will be tweaks I've made.
This is my working/learning document and is not identical to course code in all repects.
